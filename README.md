This is a personal Portfolio Website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my profile, projects, education, and skills. The HTML file structures the website into different sections such as Home, Projects, Education, Skills, and Contact with a responsive navigation bar for smooth section navigation. The CSS file (portfolio.css) is used to design the layout with proper spacing, styling, colors, responsive grid systems, and attractive project and skill cards to create a clean and modern user interface. The JavaScript file (portfolio.js) enhances interactivity by implementing dynamic features such as typing animation in the hero section, smooth scrolling, and other interactive effects. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills, including responsive design, DOM manipulation, structured layout creation, and user-friendly interface development. It serves as a professional digital portfolio to present my technical skills and academic background.
